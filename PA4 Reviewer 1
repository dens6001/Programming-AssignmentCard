Dani,

Great job on you programming assignment four.
The only advice I have for you on this assignment is to 
make it usable on a tablet as well. It is pretty simple, all you
need to do is adjust the image/text placement by using pixels 
rather than percentages. Other than that it looks very clean and effective. Nice Job!
